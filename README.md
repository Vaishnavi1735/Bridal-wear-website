# Bridal Saree Website   
_Elegant. Traditional. User-Centric._

##  Project Overview
On the very first day of using the **Odoo Website Builder**, I successfully created a complete bridal saree website — from layout planning and styling to content writing and branding. This project captures the grace and richness of traditional Indian bridal wear with a clean, modern interface for a seamless user experience.

>  A short video attached in this repo showcases the **first design output**, highlighting elegance, tradition, and user-focused design.
